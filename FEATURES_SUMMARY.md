# Retatrutide Tracker - Features Summary

## 🎉 What's Been Added

Your app now has **enterprise-level data protection and management** features!

---

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. **Resilient Data Storage** 🛡️

Your data is now protected with multiple layers:

- **Dual Storage**: Both localStorage AND IndexedDB
- **Automatic Failover**: If one fails, uses the other
- **Corruption Recovery**: Automatically backs up corrupted data
- **Sync Feature**: Keep both storage layers in sync

**What this means**: Your data won't disappear even if localStorage fails!

---

### 2. **Automatic Backups** 💾

Every 5 minutes, your data is automatically backed up:

- **10 automatic backups** kept rolling
- **Works silently** in the background
- **Can be disabled** if needed
- **Zero user action** required

**What this means**: You can roll back to any point in the last ~50 minutes!

---

### 3. **Manual Backups** 👤

Create labeled backups anytime:

- **Custom labels**: "Before deleting old data", "End of month", etc.
- **5 manual backups** kept
- **One-click restore**
- **Export to file** for offline storage

**What this means**: Create recovery points before major changes!

---

### 4. **Export/Import** 📥📤

Take your data anywhere:

- **Export to JSON file**: Download your entire database
- **Import from file**: Restore from any backup
- **Share between devices**: Transfer data easily
- **Offline backups**: Store on your computer/cloud

**What this means**: Your data is truly yours and portable!

---

### 5. **Delete Functionality** 🗑️

Finally, you can remove entries:

#### Delete Injections
- Click delete on any injection
- Undo within last 20 operations
- Automatic backup before delete

#### Delete Vials
- Safety check: Won't delete if injections reference it
- **Force delete option**: Removes vial AND all related injections
- Clear warning dialogs

#### Delete Weights
- Remove any weight entry
- Undo support
- No data dependencies

**What this means**: Clean up mistakes and old data safely!

---

### 6. **Undo System** ↩️

Made a mistake? Just undo it:

- **Last 20 operations** can be undone
- Works for ALL delete types
- Shows what operation will be undone
- One-click restore

**What this means**: Accidental deletes are no longer scary!

---

### 7. **Comprehensive Logging** 📝

Every operation is logged:

- Debug information for troubleshooting
- Performance tracking
- Error details
- Can export logs for support

**What this means**: Easy to diagnose any issues!

---

## 📚 How to Use

### Quick Start

1. **Open test page**: `test-data-protection.html`
2. **Try features**: Click buttons to test everything
3. **Check status**: See storage stats and backup info
4. **Read guide**: `DATA_PROTECTION_GUIDE.md` has full documentation

### Integration Steps

To add these features to your main app:

```javascript
// 1. Import modules
import resilientStorage from './src/core/resilient-storage.js';
import backupManager from './src/core/backup-manager.js';
import deleteManager from './src/managers/delete-manager.js';

// 2. Initialize on page load
await resilientStorage.initialize();
backupManager.initialize();

// 3. Use the features
const data = await resilientStorage.loadData();
backupManager.createManualBackup(data, 'My backup');
```

---

## 🎨 UI Components Included

Pre-built UI components in `src/ui/data-management-ui.js`:

- **Backup section**: List, create, restore, delete backups
- **Delete sections**: For injections, vials, weights
- **Statistics display**: Storage usage, backup counts
- **File import/export**: Drag-and-drop or button click

Just call `initializeDataManagementUI()` and the HTML components!

---

## 🔒 Safety Features

Every operation has multiple safety nets:

1. **Confirmation dialogs** before destructive actions
2. **Automatic backup** before major changes
3. **Reference checking** prevents orphaned data
4. **Undo capability** for accidents
5. **Storage quota** monitoring
6. **Corrupted data** recovery
